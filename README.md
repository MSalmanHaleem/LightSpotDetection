This programme is for test purpose
This is the simple command line tool for light blob detection

The command line tool can be called by three arguments
1-Input folder (In this case it is 'data'). You can change the path as per requirement
2-Input file (In this case it is Example1.tif and so on)
3-Output folder (e.g. output)

In shell script it would run as 
$ python main.py data/ Example1.tif output/
